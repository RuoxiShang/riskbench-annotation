Minor deduction because \"automatically cross-posts to three other platforms simultaneously where posts cannot be edited or deleted\" is slightly less common than the other two options, though services like Buffer/Hootsuite do offer this functionality.",
        "differentiation": "** Stark, concrete differences with specific timeframes: 72 hours to cancel vs. 24 hours to edit/delete vs. 0 ability to undo. The multi-platform aspect adds clear quantifiable spread. Easy to distinguish the three options.",

The Lower option's \"sharing disabled\" significantly reduces the warning's protective value\u2014neighbors can't alert each other. The \"PRELIMINARY\" label also undermines urgency.

        "plausibility": "** All three are realistic choices administrators face. The Higher option (image + cross-posting) and Baseline are common practices. The Lower option is slightly less common (auto-delete features aren't widely used for safety alerts), but still plausible for cautious administrators.

        "differentiation": "** Stark, concrete differences with specific numbers and mechanisms. \"Locked image\" vs \"24-hour edit window\" vs \"48-hour auto-delete\" are crystal clear. Reach is quantified (3,000 vs 3,000+ regional groups vs 3,000 only). No ambiguity about which is which.",
        "scenario_quality": "** Excellent scenario with specific context (3,000 followers, package theft, pre-conviction), clear stakes (job loss, harassment), named decision maker (administrator), and concrete constraints (unverified accusation).
