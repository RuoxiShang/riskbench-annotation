The higher-risk option's lack of human oversight and real-time algorithmic pricing clearly increases risk, while the lower-risk option's legal consultation and documentation reduce it.

The higher-risk option offers major practical advantages (real-time competitive pricing, multiple daily updates, automatic adjustment).
