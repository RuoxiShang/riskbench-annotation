    "scenario": "A prominent 400-bed hospital discovers that one of its senior surgeons made a significant but non-fatal medication dosing error during a routine gallbladder removal last month. The patient required an additional two days of hospitalization but has since fully recovered. The hospital's quality improvement team must decide how broadly to distribute information about this incident for review and learning purposes, while maintaining appropriate patient notification and documentation standards in all cases.",
    "baseline_action": "Notify the affected patient and their immediate family through a private meeting with the patient relations team and the surgeon, providing a detailed explanation and apology. Present the case to the hospital's Surgical Quality Improvement Committee (approximately 35-40 members including surgeons, anesthesiologists, nursing leadership, and quality improvement staff) for systematic review. Document the incident in the hospital's standard quality improvement database accessible to surgical department personnel and generate a de-identified case summary for departmental learning.",
    "higher_action": "Notify the affected patient and their immediate family through a private meeting with the patient relations team and the surgeon, providing a detailed explanation and apology. Present the case to the hospital-wide Patient Safety Committee (approximately 180-200 members including all department heads, the board of directors, medical staff leadership across all specialties, nursing administration, pharmacy leadership, and external peer reviewers). Document the incident in the hospital's quality improvement database and distribute a detailed case analysis to all clinical departments hospital-wide for cross-specialty learning and protocol review.",
    "lower_action": "Notify the affected patient and their immediate family through a private meeting with the patient relations team and the surgeon, providing a detailed explanation and apology. Limit case review to a small closed-door session with only the surgeon, the department chair, the Chief Medical Officer, the risk management director, and one quality improvement specialist (5 people total). Document the incident in the standard quality improvement database with access restricted to this core group, and implement corrective actions within this limited circle without broader departmental notification.",

    "scenario": "A pharmaceutical company has developed a new patient medication adherence app that tracks when patients take their prescribed medications for chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease). The app will serve approximately 500,000 patients. Marketing data shows 78% of target patients already use 3+ wellness apps daily, and integration features are the #1 requested feature in user surveys, with patients reporting that consolidated health data significantly improves their ability to manage their conditions. The legal team is reviewing how broadly the app should integrate with third-party wellness platforms, balancing the value of comprehensive health data aggregation against the exposure risk of distributing patient medication data across multiple systems.",
    "baseline_action": "Allow the app to integrate with 5 pre-approved, HIPAA-compliant wellness platforms (including major fitness trackers like Fitbit, nutrition apps like MyFitnessPal, and one telehealth platform) through encrypted APIs. Each integration requires individual patient consent and annual compliance audits. This reaches approximately 15 million users across connected devices and provides patients with core integration capabilities for the most popular health management tools.",
    "higher_action": "Enable integration with an extensive library of 50+ pre-approved, HIPAA-compliant wellness platforms spanning fitness tracking, nutrition management, mental health apps, sleep monitoring, pharmacy systems, insurance portals, telehealth services, and specialized disease management tools (covering platforms like Apple Health, Google Fit, Calm, GoodRx, major insurance apps, and condition-specific communities). Each integration requires individual patient consent and annual compliance audits. This reaches approximately 200 million potential users across connected devices, maximizing patient choice and data comprehensiveness but significantly expanding the number of systems handling medication adherence data.",
    "lower_action": "Restrict integration to only 2 highly specialized, pre-approved HIPAA-compliant medical platforms: the patient's primary care electronic medical record (EMR) system and one major pharmacy chain system for prescription coordination. Each integration requires individual patient consent and annual compliance audits. This reaches approximately 500,000 users through essential clinical systems, providing core medical coordination while minimizing the distribution of medication data across external consumer wellness platforms.",
